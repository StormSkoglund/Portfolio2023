  Hi, my name is Alex and Iâ€™m passionate about Frontend Development.
</h2>
<p class="me-p">
  For the longest time, I felt like I was missing a vital part of my
  life, until I discovered that my urge to be creative wasn't being
  fully fulfilled.
</p>
<p class="me-p">
  I worked as a field archaeologist when I realized that I needed to
  pursue my passion, while I still had the opportunity. Perhaps it was
  the main theme of my job back then, time itself, that triggered me,
  but I don't know for sure.
</p>
<p class="me-p">
  Nevertheless, one thing led to another and I applied for the 2-year
  online Frontend Development course, available through Noroff. So here
  I am, one year in, and you are now looking at my portfolio, which
  demonstrates the creative journey I have been on.
</p>
<h2 class="h2-me-about">About The Projects</h2>
<p class="me-p">
  This portfolio consists of the three main projects I have created
  throughout the one year I have been studying frontend so far.
</p>
<p class="me-p">
  The first two projects consisted solely of HTML and CSS, though I
  added JavaScript to the first project at a later point. The third
  project was the first one where I combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  from the beginning. Therefore, I found it much easier to both design
  and program a site as I originally had intended.
</p>
<p class="me-p">
  The first project lack some of the fine-tuning and attention to
  detail that the other projects received. Some of the features in the
  first project serve only as placeholders for now.
