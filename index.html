          Hi, my name is Alex and Iâ€™m passionate about Frontend Development.
        </h2>
        <p class="me-p">
          For the longest time, I felt like I was missing a vital part of my
          life, until I discovered that my urge to be creative wasn't being
          fully fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p class="me-p">
          I worked as a field archaeologist when I realized that I needed to
          pursue my passion, while I still had the opportunity. Perhaps it was
          the main theme of my job back then, time itself, that triggered me,
          but I don't know for sure.
        </p>
        <p class="me-p">
          Nevertheless, one thing led to another and I applied for the 2-year
          online Frontend Development course, available through Noroff. So here
          I am, one year in, and you are now looking at my portfolio, which
          demonstrates the creative journey I have been on.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-me-about">About The Projects</h2>
        <p class="me-p">
          This portfolio consists of the three main projects I have created
          throughout the one year I have been studying frontend so far.
        </p>
        <p class="me-p">
          The first two projects consisted solely of HTML and CSS, though I
          added JavaScript to the first project at a later point. The third
          project was the first one where I combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
          from the beginning. Therefore, I found it much easier to both design
          and program a site as I originally had intended.
        </p>
        <p class="me-p">
          The first two projects lack some of the fine-tuning and attention to
          detail that the other projects received. Some of the features in the
          first project serve only as placeholders for now.
