# Portfolio2023

![image](/Images/Portfolio%20Site.jpg)

This is a showcase of my skills as a Student Frontend Developer at Noroff. It features three diverse and innovative projects that I have created during my first year.

## Description

My portfolio consist of three websites, each with different themes and features.

Game Hub: A website for a fictitious online game store. This project was originally created using only HTML and CSS. JavaScript was added at a later stage, when programming was being introduced through the curriculum.

The Community Science Museum: This website was created solely with CSS and HTML. The idea was to emulate a real museum with plenty of events and content. The site was heavy on copy and therefore it also needed many pages.

Ancient Recipes: This blog-site was built with an educational purpose in mind, rather than that of a platform for an influencer. The content consisted of a multitude of different ancient recipes, served alongside plenty of historical facts.

## Built With
